A Sauce for Zwift "Mod" is a directory placed in `~/Documents/SauceMods`.  NOTE: "Documents"
may be called "My Documents" on some platforms.  For first time mod users they should create
an empty **SauceMods** folder first.  Then each Mod will be a sub directory in there such as...
```
Documents
└── SauceMods
    ├── sauce4zwift-larsenlp-mods
    └── super_duper_theme_mod
```
